# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
## Advanced Python
- Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means that variable types are dynamically set at run-time, upon assignment of a value to a variable.

- For example, in

>>> def fn(a, b):
>>>    return a + b
The types of a and b are not known at build-time, only when a and b are assigned values at run-time.

- Hence, calling

fn("a", 1)
- somewhere in your code will not raise an exception until the code is actually executed and the function is called:

>>> fn("a", 1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
- TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
In Python 3, type annotations do not change this. Python is still a dynamically-typed language. Type annotations serve the following purpose:

- Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone else’s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
