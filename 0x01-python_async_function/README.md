# 0x01. Python - Async
## Python
## Back-end

This project is a learning exercise on using Python's `asyncio` library to handle asynchronous programming. It covers the basics of `async` and `await` syntax, executing async programs, running concurrent coroutines, creating asyncio tasks, and using the `random` module within an async context.
